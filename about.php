	    		<p>
	    			I'm John Forrest, a Seattle-based, front-end web developer. Before I discovered my passion for 
	    			web development, I was a high school science teacher. When designing lesson plans, I had to design for 
	    			the needs of my students. This skill has proven essential to making websites with the user in mind. 
	    			I am currently taking on new projects, so <a href="contact.php">contact me</a> if you'd like to discuss what I can do for you.
