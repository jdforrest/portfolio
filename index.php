    			<p>
    				A baking blog focused on providing healthy recipes using a variety of whole grains. 
    				Since this needed to be a blog, I developed the site in WordPress using only a few plugins. 
    				The most important feature of this blog was the single.php file.  The single post page needed to 
    				have a large featured image, lists for both ingredients and preparation, social buttons for recipe sharing, 
    				and a method to print or email the recipe.

    			<p>
    				I created this online resume for a JavaScript class.  Using the jQuery library, our goal was to make a resume 
    				that allowed the user to switch the overall style with a click of a link. This resume uses three stylesheets 
    				that can be toggled with the three links in the header. In addition, this resume has a "Toggle Details" link 
    				for each job. When click, a box slides in from the right to provide more details for the position.

    			<p>
    				This is the first website I ever created. The goal was to provide an online gallery for Kathy Kimball's art, 
    				as well as a space for a blog once I learned PHP and/or WordPress. I used no PHP and a little JavaScript for 
    				form verification. Other than that, this whole site was made using HTML5 and CSS3 only. Iâ€™m including this piece 
    				to show where I have come from.  Considering that this was the first site I ever created, I think this is pretty good. 
    				However, looking back, I have definitely come a long way.
